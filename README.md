I am using mongoDb Live it will automatically retrive the data into the portfolio site. 
All required information is labeled/commented in the backend
and portfolio projects files as required. 


The portfolio has 3 pages
Home, Projects and skills
The home page has basically all personal informational data.
Projects retrieves data from the database to display projects I have done. A short blurb of information is provided about the project. As moving forward in the future their may be lots of projects. 
  making it short and straight forward is the best. The readme in each file has lots of description. 
Skills shows all the programming languages and skills i have used to develop projects with. 

Due to time contraints: 
I have shown 2 projects for the projects page as a proof of concept and will look forward to implementing and further implmenting during the week break.
